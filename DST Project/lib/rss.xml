 <br>DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME<br>Looking back . . .<br>
'Fast time' causes tense time at Capitol<br>Last week Minnesotans moved their clocks ahead one hour with<br>
scarcely a fuss.<br>But more than 20 years ago, the issue of daylight savings time<br>
was one of the most hotly debated topics in the state. It pitted<br>
rural interests against the metro area, and the judiciary against<br>
the executive branch.<br>The Legislature, as usual, was caught in the middle.<br>"After two summers of DST (daylight savings time), legislators<br>
and Gov. Orville Freeman report that it has caused more vocal<br>
protests than virtually any other piece of 1957 legislation,"<br>
stated the Minneapolis Star, Jan. 28, 1959.<br>Added Rep. Willard Munger (DFL-Duluth), "I don't know why people<br>
got so emotional over it, but they sure did."<br>Farmers complained that "they cannot get into the fields any<br>
earlier than under standard time . . . because the morning sun<br>
does not dry the dew 'on daylight savings time,'" stated the same<br>
Star article.<br>Marjorie James wrote a letter dated May 23, 1960, to the St. Paul<br>
Dispatch denouncing the idea because, as most parents know, it's<br>
harder to get children to bed when it's light outside.<br>"Putting clocks back an hour would give us much needed relief<br>
from children, who seem to think because it is still daylight<br>
they should be allowed to run up and down the streets shouting<br>
and screaming," wrote James.<br>The president of an association of movie theaters wrote that<br>
daylight savings time would be the "death knell" for movie<br>
theaters because people wouldn't go when it's light outside.<br>And the executive vice president of the Minneapolis Grain<br>
Exchange complained in 1960 that the daylight savings time<br>
adopted by Minnesota didn't conform to the standard set in<br>
roughly half the other states at that time.<br>"If Minnesota wants to compete in the world of business we must<br>
adopt practices which help industrial expansion in our state,"<br>
wrote George Wilkins in the May 3, 1960, Star. "It is necessary<br>
that we place in a secondary position 'the sleeping habits of<br>
small children.' It seems to me it is of paramount importance<br>
that 'dad have a job,' even though this might mean the children<br>
will be up until 9:30 p.m. on long summer evenings."<br>The concept of daylight savings time had been around for years.<br>
In fact, Minnesota adopted it during the two world wars to save<br>
energy.<br>But the skirmishing in the Legislature began in earnest in 1957<br>
with the passage of two laws concerning daylight savings time, or<br>
"fast time," as it was called then.<br>The first bill allowed Hennepin and Ramsey counties, and counties<br>
contiguous to them, and the city of Duluth to adopt daylight<br>
savings time on their own.<br>But in a lawsuit brought by an alliance of movie theaters, the<br>
Minnesota Supreme Court issued a ruling that barred the counties<br>
from adopting a different time from the rest of the state and<br>
urged the Legislature to adopt a uniform policy.<br>Then Attorney General Miles Lord issued an opinion that claimed<br>
the high court's action had no effect on the counties. <br>The result was that some parts of the state were on a different<br>
time than others -- a schism that was reflected by state<br>
government in 1957. On the second floor of the state Capitol, the<br>
Legislature and the Minnesota Supreme Court remained on standard<br>
time while the Governor's Office adopted "fast time."<br>"The fast time issue was one of the greatest legislative battles<br>
in Minnesota history . . .," declared the St. Paul Dispatch, May<br>
20, 1960.<br>The dispute was temporarily resolved with passage of a bill in<br>
1957 that allowed the governor to adopt daylight savings time for<br>
the whole state.<br>And in 1959 in a special session of the Legislature, a permanent<br>
daylight savings time law was approved. But in a compromise, its<br>
length was made the shortest in the nation -- extending from the<br>
fourth Sunday in May to the Tuesday following Labor Day. <br>In 1966, the U.S. Congress, tired of the patchwork daylight<br>
savings time zones across the country, passed a law that<br>
pre-empted state law and made daylight savings, which runs from<br>
the first Sunday in April to the last Sunday in October, uniform.<br>Although many rural Minnesotans were adamantly opposed to "fast<br>
time," a 1961 Minnesota Poll showed that a majority of<br>
Minnesotans supported the concept. The poll in April showed 57<br>
percent in favor of "fast time" while 35 percent opposed it --<br>
although 68 percent of the "farm people" still opposed daylight<br>
savings time.<br>Its time had come. In fact, a woman from southern Minnesota made<br>
it clear that she was adopting daylight standard time no matter<br>
what the Legislature did.<br>"A housewife in so far standard time Le Sueur County . . . says<br>
her house is going on daylight savings, law or no law," stated an<br>
Associated Press story of April 25, 1959.<br>--Grant Moos<br>

They propose that these clocks have relationships and defined relatively. So when DST shifts everything it breaks all the ratios between the clocks. They refrance some papers on how even living on the western most areas of time zones can lead to health problems, but I'm not able to verify (2024-10-02 11:34).<br>
 Several studies found that the further west people live within a time zone, the more health problems they may experience and the shorter they live on average (Borisenkov, 2011; Gu et al., 2017; VoPham et al., 2018)
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="roenneberg-et-al-2019-why-should-we-abolish-daylight-saving-time.pdf > page=2&amp;selection=128,14,132,20" data-href="roenneberg-et-al-2019-why-should-we-abolish-daylight-saving-time.pdf#page=2&amp;selection=128,14,132,20" href="https://aresidentofkyoto.github.io/DST Project/sources/roenneberg-et-al-2019-why-should-we-abolish-daylight-saving-time.pdf#page=2&amp;selection=128,14,132,20" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">roenneberg-et-al-2019-why-should-we-abolish-daylight-saving-time, page 2</a><br>Furthermore the authors mention China's 1 unified time zone and how that cause problems, because we live according to the same social. But from what I have indirectly researched Chinese people on the western areas just shift things basically making there own time zones. As in people in the western provinces may eat at a later time for breakfast than eastern coast people (2024-10-02 11:54).<br>After reading Borisenkov, 2011's abstract, I am unsure of the academic credibility. It seems slightly absurd to be true, but there is the other 2 articles to read. (2024-10-06 17:19)<br>
Some countries (like China) have combined neighboring time zones to make their time zones bigger, so that the sun needs even longer than 1 h to cross the time zone. We live according to the same social clock time within a time zone, but as long as we still can see the natural day (through windows or on our way to or from work or school), our body clocks still follow more or less the time of the sun clock defined by the sun’s east-west path.

Shift work has been classified as a probable human carcinogen (Group 2A) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (6), based on sufficient evidence in experimental animals and epidemiologic studies of breast cancer in female shift workers and flight attendants.

<br>notes: We have to go back to all the way to 1784. where this gentleman on the left. {speak less brazenly} Who you might recognize as Benjamin Franklin. {return to normal present voice} Writes a letter to the Journal of Paris {sidenote voice} a scientific journal {return to normal} about how we could save money if we just woke up when the sun goes up and sleep when the sun goes down.  {questioning} Wait how is this DST? {answer tone} It isn't, but this uses the core idea of using more daylight and less energy. But this other lad on the right? He is  William Willett. The real person who created DST in its first form. He proposed to parliament a schedule of clock changes to advance the clocks a total of 80 minutes in the summer. This worked by shifting the clocks 20 minutes every Sunday at 2 am starting in April. and reverse starting in September. {side comment} I feel bad for the people who would have to stay up to change the clocks every Sunday night. {normal} But luckily for those people, Parliament thought it was to complicated and declined the idea.<br><br>

  notes: So war. Huh? How did that get here? aren't we talking about time zones. The most heated it gets is a protest, Not a war? Well, what to governments like to conserve during war? Energy and so daylight saving time is the perfect thing for a country like Imperial Germany to adopt. So they did. DST then became adopted by most in Europe. In 1918 the United States joined DST and the war. But as we know the war end and all country returned to standard time. Hope that doesn't happen again…

 notes: You're telling me that. There is this former failure of an art student and Stalin taking over Poland starting a second world war? Welp, good luck. WW2 leads to the adoption of DST as an energy saving measure again, but this time all year round. Year round Daylight saving time. What we do know that the war ends, and most country's in Europe and North America adopt summer DST. The form we use today.

notes: In blue is the areas that use DST and red and orange are areas that don't.<br><br><br><br><br><img alt="Things that effect estimates of DST savings.png" src="https://aresidentofkyoto.github.io/DST Project/things-that-effect-estimates-of-dst-savings.png" style="width: 800px; max-width: 100%;"><br>Notes: People say DST saves energy (that why we use it), but is that really the case? It turns out there are many factors to see if DST does anything. As you can see anything from location to if you have a tendency to go out at night can lead to different estimates. This makes it really hard to estimate if on average it saves energy overall. According to Myriam Aires, a researcher at the Institute for Research in Construction in Ottawa Canada, The savings across different countries averages between 0.5 and 2.5 percent. Myraim gives us an example of how much really means compared to change light bulbs to in California (i know oddly specific). "California {has} around 21 light fixtures per household. Of these 21 light fixtures, only one uses a CFL, on average. Replacing an additional four incandescent fixtures with CFLs would reduce installed lighting power by about 15%, and therefore total annual electricity use would be reduced by approximately 0.5%." But they say on a national scale DST is saving a decent amount of energy.<br><br><br><img alt="Pasted image 20241023074211.png" src="https://aresidentofkyoto.github.io/DST Project/pasted-image-20241023074211.png"><br>
notes: Turns out DST can affect your health. Having your circadian rhythm messed up also causes major problems. It can lead to increased effects of psychiatric symptoms like depression. Also, the underlining shock or unreadiness for a sudden jump in time leads to increased alertness. After which leads to a decrease in alertness and more traffic incidents.<br><br><br>notes: Looking back on the history of DST. There seems to be a hole in the people who really signed it to law. With a history that literary changes time its surprising that that info is left out. And the fact that not much is known if it even works is more telling of how we trusted thought without testing.]]></description><link>https://aresidentofkyoto.github.io/DST Project/draft-of-10-img.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">draft of 10 img.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2024 16:53:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/DST_Countries_Map.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/DST_Countries_Map.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How can DST affect you?]]></title><description><![CDATA[

&gt; [!info] I considered that, if I had not been awakened so early in the morning, I should have slept six hours longer by the light of the sun, and in exchange have lived six hours the following night by candle-light; and, the latter being a much more expensive light than the former,
&gt; **Benjamin Franklin's**


&gt; [!info] I therefore venture to propose that at 2 a.m. on each of four Sunday mornings in April, standard time shall advance 20 minutes; and on each of four Sundays in September, shall recede 20 minutes, or in other words that for eight Sundays of 24 hours each, we shall substitute four, each 20 minutes less than 24 hours, and four each 20 minutes more than 24 hours.

<br>notes:<br>
Benjamin Franklin considered how the sun shifts away from the clocks. He noticed that if you move the clocks back to sync more with the sun. You use less candles and therefore more money. but the first proposal was cast aside from its complicated changing time schedules. When the electrification was happening in Britain, William Willett wrote a pamphlet on a crude version of DST. Then the transcontinental railroad happened leading to the creation of time zones. Why time zones? We will come back to this.<br><br><br>
<br>To save energy
<br>To roughly sync clock times to sun times
